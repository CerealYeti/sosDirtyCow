<div class="post">
  <p>This week we were officially prohibited from coming to campus to work on the network, due to the Covid-19 campus lock down and stay-at-home order. We asked Richard to try to get us access to the PCC again, but he said it would take some time as he was getting quite a bit of push back from Police Services.</p>
