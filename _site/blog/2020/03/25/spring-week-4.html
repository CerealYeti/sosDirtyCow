  <p>We have officially heard back from Richard that we will no longer be able to access the PCC, along with our networking cart. So we have moved on to thinking about what else we can work on for our project that is still related to the network in a cart project. The main idea that we came up with was making our own exploitable VMâ€™s since we were just planning to grab pre-made scenarios that others had built online.</p>
