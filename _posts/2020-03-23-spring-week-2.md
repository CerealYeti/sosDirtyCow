Continued to work on why packets flowed only one way. One of our possible solutions to this problem was to change the routing protocols from rip to eigrp, because eigrp is the routing protocol specifically designed for CISCO swithces and routers. We started studying eirgrp protocol in preparation for reconfiguring the swithces and routers. We also started a complete reconfiguration of Leopard, since it's configuration had been erased.
