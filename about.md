# About page



We are two seniors at Evergreen State college working on completing the configuration of an Isolated Network in a Cart. We are looking to have this setup as a totally isolated network testlab on wheels for future students to use. We had to change the direction that this project went because of covid-19. We would still like to finish this other project given the opportunity but the new project is described below.

The purpose of the project is now to gain understanding of kernel exploitations by building a vulnerable virtual machine to demonstrate privilege escalation in Linux. The exploit used to accomplish this is Dirty COW, a known vulnerability in the Linux community. The paper will explore how the virtual machine was created, the kernel processes that allow for Dirty COW to occur, and how a program could be written to exploit this vulnerability.
