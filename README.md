#SOS ISOLATED NETWORK JOURNAL
## WINTER QUARTER
### Week 1
Spent the week just trying to connect our laptops to the box and figure out what ethernet plug-ins matched to which VLan's. Couldn't get our computers to talk over the network though.
### Week 2
Were able to communicate between to laptops on the same VLan's but we still aren't able to communicate from two different VLan's.
### Week 3
Figured out how to open a connection to the cli's on the switches and routers and have started to learn the basics of the cisco CLI. We also recieved server components from Shay but haven't done anything with them yet.
### Week 4
Bought a power supply that we were missing for the server motherboard. But haven't tried hooking it up and seeing if it works altogether.
### Week 5
### Week 6
Tried connecting all the server components and running the server, but it isn't working correctly. The motherboard says that it is recieving the correct amount of power from the 12 pin plug from the power supply but it looks like the cpu might not be recieving power. We will have to perform further testing to find the problem.
### Week 7
Found that the Leapord Switch box was reset somehow and erased it's own configurations. We do not have back ups of any of the servers configs. We will need to reconfigure leopard and back up every box's configurations so if this does happen again we can just reload the configs.
### Week 8
Had a meeting with Michael Partlow, the original designer of the network that David built. We learned a lot of useful information from him and a much more detailed overview of how the network was configured, how to debug different aspects of the network and now have a better understanding of the CISCO CLI.
