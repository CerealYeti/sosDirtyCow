## WINTER QUARTER
### Week 1
Spent the week just trying to connect our laptops to the box and figure out what ethernet plug-ins matched to which VLan's. Couldn't get our computers to talk over the network though.
### Week 2
Were able to communicate between to laptops on the same VLan's but we still aren't able to communicate from two different VLan's.
### Week 3
Figured out how to open a connection to the cli's on the switches and routers and have started to learn the basics of the cisco CLI. We also recieved server components from Shay but haven't done anything with them yet.
### Week 4
Bought a power supply that we were missing for the server motherboard. But haven't tried hooking it up and seeing if it works altogether.
### Week 5
### Week 6
Tried connecting all the server components and running the server, but it isn't working correctly. The motherboard says that it is recieving the correct amount of power from the 12 pin plug from the power supply but it looks like the cpu might not be recieving power. We will have to perform further testing to find the problem.
### Week 7
Found that the Leapord Switch box was reset somehow and erased it's own configurations. We do not have back ups of any of the servers configs. We will need to reconfigure leopard and back up every box's configurations so if this does happen again we can just reload the configs.
### Week 8
Had a meeting with Michael Partlow, the original designer of the network that David built. We learned a lot of useful information from him and a much more detailed overview of how the network was configured, how to debug different aspects of the network and now have a better understanding of the CISCO CLI.
### Week 9
### Week 10

## Spring Quarter
### Week 1 
Backed up the switches. Worked on getting packets to flow both ways between the two layer two domains. 
### Week 2
Continued to work on why packets flowed only one way. One of our possible solutions to this problem was to change the routing protocols from rip to eigrp, because eigrp is the routing protocol specifically designed for CISCO swithces and routers. We started studying eirgrp protocol in preparation for reconfiguring the swithces and routers. We also started a complete reconfiguration of Leopard, since it's configuration had been erased. 
### Week 3
This week we were officially prohibited from coming to campus to work on the network, due to the Covid-19 campus lock down and stay-at-home order. We asked Richard to try to get us access to the PCC again, but he said it would take some time as he was getting quite a bit of push back from Police Services. 
### Week 4
We have officially heard back from Richard that we will no longer be able to access the PCC, along with our networking cart. So we have moved on to thinking about what else we can work on for our project that is still related to the network in a cart project. The main idea that we came up with was making our own exploitable VM's since we were just planning to grab pre-made scenarios that others had built online.
### Week 5
We started researching different exploits that we would want to put into our VM's. It does seem a little redundant though from all the resources that already exist on the internet. We have been brainstorming other ideas to work on besides the exloitable VM's, but we really haven't come up with anything so far.
### Week 6
So we had the idea of setting up our own exploitable VM that we would then hack into so we could learn more cyber security techniques from the perspective of an attacker.
