	<h1>From Carts to COW's</h1>
	<p>The purpose of the project is now to gain understanding of kernel exploitations by building a vulnerable virtual machine to demonstrate privilege escalation in Linux. The exploit used to accomplish this is Dirty COW, a known vulnerability in the Linux community. The paper will explore how the virtual machine was created, the kernel processes that allow for Dirty COW to occur, and how a program could be written to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
